                    <p>
                        Nutrition is 50% of the fitness equation. Revon Fitness
                        provides customized meal plans designed to support your
                        specific goals whether you're building muscle, losing
                        fat, or improving athletic performance. Our nutrition
                        system takes the guesswork out of eating for fitness.

                    <p>
                        Based on your caloric needs, dietary preferences,
                        allergies, and goals, we generate meal plans with
                        recipes, shopping lists, and prep instructions. Every
                        meal is optimized for the right balance of protein,
                        carbs, and healthy fats.

                        Your nutrition plan automatically adjusts based on your

                        calories to fuel performance and recovery. On rest days,
                        the app adjusts your targets to match your lower energy
                        expenditure. This intelligent syncing ensures you're
                        always eating the right amount for your activity level.
